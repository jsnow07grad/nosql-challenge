Instructions

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom and gives them a food hygiene rating. You’ve been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up

Use NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb for this section of the challenge. 1. Import the data provided in the establishments.json file from your Terminal. • Name the database uk_food and the collection establishments. • Copy the text you used to import your data from your Terminal to a markdown cell in your notebook. 2. Within your notebook, import the libraries you need: • PyMongo and Pretty Print (pprint). 3. Create an instance of the Mongo Client. 4. Confirm that you created the database and loaded the data properly: • List the databases you have in MongoDB. Confirm that uk_food is listed. • List the collection(s) in the database to ensure that establishments is there. • Find and display one document in the establishments collection using find_one() and display with pprint. • Assign the establishments collection to a variable to prepare the collection for use.

Find the BusinessTypeID for “Restaurant/Cafe/Canteen” and return only the BusinessTypeID and BusinessType fields. 3. Update the new restaurant with the BusinessTypeID you found. 4. Remove establishments in Dover: • Check how many documents contain the Dover Local Authority. • Remove any establishments within the Dover Local Authority from the database. • Check the number of documents to ensure they were deleted. 5. Convert string values to appropriate data types: • Use update_many to convert latitude and longitude to decimal numbers. • Use update_many to convert RatingValue to integer numbers.
Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
Use NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb for this section of the challenge.

Exploration Questions

1.    Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
•    Use count_documents to display the number of documents contained in the result.
•    Display the first document in the results using pprint.
•    Convert the result to a Pandas DataFrame, print the number of rows in the DataFrame, and display the first 10 rows.
2.    Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
•    Use $regex as part of your search to handle the longer name of the London Local Authority.
•    Use count_documents to display the number of documents contained in the result.
•    Display the first document in the results using pprint.
•    Convert the result to a Pandas DataFrame, print the number of rows in the DataFrame, and display the first 10 rows.
3.    What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, “Penang Flavours”?
•    Search within 0.01 degree on either side of the latitude and longitude.
•    Limit results to establishments with a RatingValue of 5.
•    Use the sort() method to sort in ascending order on the hygiene score.
•    Use the limit() method to limit the results to 5.
•    Print all five results using pprint.
•    Convert the results to a Pandas DataFrame and display them.
4.    How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?
•    Use the aggregation method to:
•    Match documents with a hygiene score of 0.
•    Group by LocalAuthorityName and count the number of documents.
•    Sort the count in descending order.
•    Print the first ten results using pprint.
•    Convert the results to a Pandas DataFrame and display the first 10 rows.
